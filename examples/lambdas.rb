#differences between lambda and proc. 1- params count matters in lambda, 2- when lambda returns it goes back to calling function, when Proc returns, it leaves everything.

#output: Batman will win!  #proc returns this and leaves
#        Iron Man will win! #lambda goes back to calling fn and prints returns last statement which is Iron Man will win!

#use lambda to return elements that are symbols only

############################

#All this talk of blocks, procs, and lambdas might have your head spinning. Let's take a minute to clarify exactly what each one is:

#A block is just a bit of code between do..end or {}. It's not an object on its own, but it can be passed to methods like .each or .select.

#A proc is a saved block we can use over and over.

#A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments it gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.

# how to mixin / use the idea of open classes, to create a custom select enumerable method. As you can see it can be called with a block even though it takes no arguments. The block is not an argument, its called using yield. If passed as an argument, will need to call it, x.call

module Enumerable
    def select2
        r=[]
        self.each do |item|
            if yield(item)
                 r<<item
            end
        end
        return r
    end
end

less_than_2= Proc.new{|f| f<=2}

p [1,2,3,4].select2(&less_than_2)

###########################

#lambda can be used in rails as follows:
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    scope :find_lazy, lambda {|id| where(:id => id)}
end

# In console I can call
Person.find_lazy(1)
# called on class, not on instance of it. if instance, then make a normal method.

#so you're passing a block to find_lazy, which accepts one parameter which is the id. if Person.find_lazy(1,2) then lambda will be {|a,b| .. } i believe.
